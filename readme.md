## Usage

### Basic Setup

To integrate `@marekkedzia/api-client` into your application:

import { ApiClient } from '@marekkedzia/api-client';

const client = new ApiClient({
    url: 'https://api.yourservice.com',
    authHeader: async () => 'Bearer your-token', // Custom function to fetch authorization headers
});

const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
        const response = await client.call({
            method: 'GET',
            path: '/data',
        });

### Advanced Features

#### Retry Mechanism
The retry logic is customizable and handles transient errors like `5xx` responses by default. You can provide:
- **Custom retry conditions**
- **Before-retry hooks**

Example:
```typescript
await client.call({
    method: 'POST',
    path: '/submit',
    body: { key: 'value' },
});
```

#### Query Builder
Quickly create query strings for GET requests:
```typescript
const query = client.buildQuery({ search: 'term', page: '1' });
// Result: "?search=term&page=1"
```
